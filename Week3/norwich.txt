The Vision for Norwich University
Norwich University will be a learning community, American in character yet global in perspective; engaged in personal and intellectual transformation, and dedicated to knowledge, mutual respect, creativity, and service.

The Mission of Norwich University
To give our youth an education that shall be American in its character – to enable them to act as well as to think – to execute as well as to conceive – “to tolerate all opinions when reason is left free to combat them” – to make moral, patriotic, efficient, and useful citizens, and to qualify them for all those high responsibilities resting upon a citizen in this free republic.
